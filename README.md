# Tauri Plugin openurl

Open url in browser on all platforms<sup>1</sup> (excluding IOS, still in testing). Basically `<a target="_blank"></a>` replacement for all platforms<sup>1</sup>.


## Usage

This plugin is still part of Tauri V2 Beta. So, this project might be replaced by a fix in Tauri core itself before project is stable.
